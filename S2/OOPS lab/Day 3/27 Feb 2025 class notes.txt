________________________

write a java program to sort an array

create a class Test, with two int variables a and b, declare a parameterized constructor with two variables x and y of integer type.
Assign x to a and y to b. Close the constructor then you have a method called equals and the return type of method equals is Boolean.
And it takes a parameter and the parameter name is ob of type your class type. 


equals()---------->
if (ob.a == a) && (ob.b == b) {
	return True;
} else {
	return False
}

close the equals method

main()---------->


create an object o1, and pass two values 10 and 20.
create another object o2 with same values 10 and 20, 
o3 with values 1 and 5;

SOP ("o1==o2" + o1.equals(o2)); 
SOP ("o1==o3" + o1.equals(o3));



class Parent {
	______________
	______________
}

class Child extends Parent {
	public void main(String args[]) {
		Child c = new Child();
	}
}




in inheritance create child class object
you can use child class object to invoke parent class variables and methods
no need to explicitly create parent object


Create a class Parent. 
SOP("This is Parent class"); within parent's constructor
close the class parent
now derive the child from parent class



Create a class called Animal
Declare a variable colour of type String
Initialize the colour variable with any color
Create a subclass Animal2 from Animal
declare the variable colour with different colour name
Declare a method called colourDisplay of type void
SOP(display the colour value)
close the function
PSVM() {
	create an object for the child class
}


**super as a reference variable-used to refer the immediate parent class object.**
Whenever the instance of a subclass is created, an instance of parent class is created implicitly, which is referred by super keyword.

colourDisplay() {
	SOP ("Colour of parent class" + super.colour);
}


l and b of integer type
create a parameterized constructor with parameters x and y of int type
assign x and y to l and b
a method called area in that 
SOP(find area l*b)
close the parent class
create a child from your parent class; declare a  variable h of int type
Now declare a parameterized constructor that takes a single argument z of type int
assign z to h;
print h;

PSVM() {
	create an object of child class
	you can pass any 3 values. 
	call the area method
}


inside your child class constructor give 
super(m, n)
first arguments should be arguments of your super class

include a method volume in derived class void type
find the volume l*b*h
print it, and call the volume method.



subclass constructor uses super keywords (methods) to invoke the super class constructor. 
super may only be used within a subclass constructor.
The call to superclass constructor using super method must appear as the first statement in the subclass constructor.
The parameters in the super call must match the order and type of the instance variables declared in the super class. 


write a java program to demonstrate multilevel inheritance
